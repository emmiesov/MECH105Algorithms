# Help Text for a MATLAB algorithm focusing on Simpson's 1/3 and Trapezoidal rules of integration:
This function evaluates an integral given by the user with Simpson's 1/3 and Trapezoidal rules.
First, the function receives the user's two arrays for x and y values and evaluates them as integral.
Next, this function determines the length of the arrays, ensuring they match and if values are equally spaced.
Then, the number of segments in the data is calculated, determining if the numerical integration calculation 
is only composite Simpson's 1/3 rule or composite Simpson's 1/3 rule with a single application of the trapezoidal rule for the final interval.
The rules applied to the integral depend on if the intervals are even or odd because Simpson's 1/3 requires three points,
and the trapezoidal requires only two points to integrate.
