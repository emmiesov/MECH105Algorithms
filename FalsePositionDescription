# Description of a MATLAB algorithm for the root-finding method, false position.
This function computes the root of a function using the false position method. 
This root-finding method creates a secant line with the upper and lower bounds. 
To find the secant line, I used this equation: xr = xu - f(xu)*(xl-xu)/f(xl)-f(xu).
The given function is evaluated at xr and the lower bound, respectively. 
Then, each calculation's results are multiplied to determine which bound xr will replace.
