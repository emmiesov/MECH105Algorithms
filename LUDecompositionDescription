# Help Description for a LU Decomposition MATLAB algorithm:
This function evaluates a matrix the user gives using forward elimination, backward substitution, and pivoting.
This function determines whether or not the matrix is square. 
If no, LU Decomposition cannot be applied. 
If yes, three matrices are created, which act as the bases for the upper triangular, lower triangular, and permutation matrices.
This function finds the row where the element in the first column has the greatest value and performs pivoting.
This step repeats until the upper triangular and permutation matrices are complete.
The modified matrices are used to determine the lower triangular matrix using the permutation matrix.
