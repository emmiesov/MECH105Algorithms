# Help Text For Linear Regression MATLAB Algorithm:
This function computes the linear regression of a data set.
This data set consists of two arrays. 
One is for the x-values, and the second is for the corresponding y-values:
The sort function is utilized to rearrange the order of both arrays.
The indices are found using the Minitab Method equations on Wolfram's website, Mathworld.
The lower bounds are determined to be compared to the rearranged arrays. This process filters outliers from the data.
The linear regression slope, intercept, and R-squared value are calculated.
